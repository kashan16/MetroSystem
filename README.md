# MetroSystem
METRO SYSTEM : 
A c++ program that uses different algorithms like Dijkstra(to print minimum distance)
,breadth-first search, depth-first search, etc,the shortest path between the source station 
and the destination station is determined, and accordingly,the fare is being calculated on 
the basis of the total distance between the two stations.A graph is used to store the station(vertex) and distance(weight of edges)
Finally, the metro route between the two stations and the total fare(minimum distance * fare{predetermined}) is displayed.
